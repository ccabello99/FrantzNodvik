# Frantz-Nodvik equation solver in 2+1D

Julia code capable of simulating the amplification of a laser pulse in a multi-pass amplifier. It is currentlyconfigured to simulate amplification in titanium-doped sapphire. The emission and absorption cross-sections ofTi:Sapphire, and the nonlinear refrative index of sapphire are provided. The 2D spatial profiles for both the seed and pump beams can be defined by the user, and the temporal profile of the seed pulse can also be defined.
